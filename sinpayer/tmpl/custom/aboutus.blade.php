        <p>
            The Forex market focuses on the trade of currencies by both large investment banks and individuals around the world. Trading can be done in nearly all currencies, however, a small group known as the 'majors' is used in most trades. These currencies are the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. All currencies are quoted in currency pairs. Traders look to make a profit by betting that a currency's value will either appreciate or depreciate against another currency.
            <BR>
            <BR> The Forex market can be very volatile. But we can turn the volatility in our favor with certain trading strategies, such as widening targets, portfolio diversification, minimize risk etc. The activities of our company is also closely related to trading activity on the major stock exchanges. Most stocks are traded on exchanges, which are places where buyers and sellers meet and decide on a price.
            <BR>
            <BR> Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor. You've probably seen pictures of a trading floor, in which traders are wildly throwing their arms up, waving, yelling and signaling to each other. The other type of exchange is virtual, composed of a network of computers where trades are made electronically. The purpose of a stock market is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, reducing the risks of investing. Really, a stock market is nothing more than a super-sophisticated farmers' market linking buyers and sellers.

Our professional traders do three things that amateurs often forget. They plan a trading strategy, they monitor market daily and they diarize, track, and analyze each of their trades.
