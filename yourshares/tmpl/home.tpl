<h3>HOW WE DO IT</h3>
Our investment approach is to seek out companies that can deliver above-average returns without above-average risk. Among the companies of size worldwide, very few present worthwhile investment opportunities when measured against this demanding criterion. Long-term research shows that the companies that can deliver such above-average share price returns over the medium-to-long term, have one overriding characteristic: the ability to sustain above-average earnings growth.
<br><br>
Identifying these exceptional companies and buying them inexpensively relative to their true value is central to our detailed and disciplined stock screening process. Our analysis takes into account all global equities, all global bonds, commodities, currencies and the impact that foreign exchange rates have on markets.
